# iOS Chat App Project Plan

## Project Overview
We are developing a basic iOS chat application over a five-week period. The project is divided into five stages, with each stage having specific goals and tasks. The app will have essential features such as user authentication, real-time messaging, user profiles, and basic chat enhancements.

## Team Members
We are a team of three members.

## Project Breakdown

### Week 1: Project Setup and Basic UI Design
**Goal:** Establish the project foundation and design the main screens.

- **Team Member 1:** Set up the project in Xcode, define the app architecture (MVC, MVVM, etc.), and create a GitHub repository for version control.
- **Team Member 2:** Design the login and registration screens using SwiftUI or UIKit, focusing on navigation and basic layouts.
- **Team Member 3:** Create the initial chat screen UI with a message input field and a list view for displaying messages.

### Week 2: Authentication and Basic Navigation
**Goal:** Implement user registration and authentication.

- **Team Member 1:** Integrate Firebase (or another backend service) and implement user registration and login using email and password.
- **Team Member 2:** Connect registration and login screens to Firebase. Store user data securely and implement error handling for common scenarios.
- **Team Member 3:** Set up navigation between login, registration, and chat screens, ensuring smooth transitions.

### Week 3: Chat Functionality and Real-Time Messaging
**Goal:** Enable real-time messaging and set up the chat backend.

- **Team Member 1:** Set up a real-time database (Firebase Firestore or Realtime Database) to store chat messages and user data.
- **Team Member 2:** Implement message sending functionality and integrate it with the chat screen.
- **Team Member 3:** Develop a listener to display new incoming messages in real-time on the chat screen.

### Week 4: User Profiles and Chat Enhancements
**Goal:** Add user profile management and enhance chat features.

- **Team Member 1:** Create a user profile screen where users can update their information (name, profile picture, etc.).
- **Team Member 2:** Implement features to view a list of active chat participants or friends.
- **Team Member 3:** Enhance chat features with timestamps, read receipts, and improve the message list UI.

### Week 5: Testing, Bug Fixing, and Final Touches
**Goal:** Finalize the app, conduct testing, and polish the user experience.

- **Team Member 1:** Perform unit testing on key features like authentication, message sending, and user profile updates.
- **Team Member 2:** Conduct UI/UX testing to ensure a smooth and consistent user experience.
- **Team Member 3:** Fix any identified bugs and improve the overall app performance. Prepare the final presentation or demo, including screenshots and a feature overview.

## Final Deliverables
- Functional chat app with essential features.
- App documentation and a brief demo presentation.

## Project Structure

The project follows a well-organized structure to maintain clean code and team collaboration.
