# iOS Chat App Project Plan

## Project Overview
We are developing a basic iOS chat application over a five-week period. The project is divided into five stages, with each stage having specific goals and tasks. The app will have essential features such as user authentication, real-time messaging, user profiles, and basic chat enhancements.

## Team Members
We are a team of three members.

## Project Breakdown
